# English to Morse Code Translator
Version: 1.0

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. The purpose of this program is to translate text written in English into morse code.

# Program Description
As of April 2022, this is a simple program that takes a user's input and translates it to Morse code. In subsequent versions of this program, a GUI will be built to allow the user to encrypt and decrypt from the English language to Morse code and vise versa.
